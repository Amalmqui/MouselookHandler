# MouselookHandler

MouselookHandler is an interface addon for the World of Warcraft MMOG that adapts the game
controls to enable using [mouselook][] without the [RSI][]-inducing requirement of
perpetually pressing a mouse button.  This makes the controls resemble those of most
action games.

The addon is available on [WoWInterface][] and [CurseForge][].
